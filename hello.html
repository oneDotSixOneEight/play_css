    <p class="c01">
        A well-formed Observable can emit as many values as it needs via `next` method,
        but `complete` and `error` methods can be called only once and nothing else can be called
        thereafter. If you try to invoke `next`, `complete` or `error` methods after created
        Observable already completed or ended with an error, these calls will be ignored to
        preserve so called *Observable Contract*. Note that you are not required to call
        `complete` at any point - it is perfectly fine to create an Observable that never ends,
        depending on your needs.
    </p>

    <p class="c02"> `onSubscription` can optionally return either a function or an object with
        `unsubscribe` method. In both cases function or method will be called when
        subscription to Observable is being cancelled and should be used to clean up all
        resources. So, for example, if you are using `setTimeout` in your custom
        Observable, when someone unsubscribes, you can clear planned timeout, so that
        it does not fire needlessly and browser (or other environment) does not waste
        computing power on timing event that no one will listen to anyways.
